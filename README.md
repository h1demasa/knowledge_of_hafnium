There is a patch file in each directory of the repository that does the work of the directory name.  
You can run it by applying the patch file.  

The environment is written in repo.manifest.xml.  
This is the same as [OP-TEE/manifest/qemu\_v8.xml](https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest/blob/87c6a26d02bfba94b96af55c1521498773141f8a/qemu_v8.xml).
